QUESTION 4

select gene_name, (seq_region_end - seq_region_start) as l from gene order by l limit 1;

answer: TRDD1, length = 7

QUESTION 5

select gene_name,count(transcript_id) from gene join transcript on gene.gene_id = transcript.gene_id group by gene_name order by count(transcript_id) desc limit 1;

answer: U6, transcripts = 1329

QUESTION 6

1) 
select chromosome, count(gene_name) from gene where description rlike 'cancer' group by chromosome order by count(gene_name) desc limit 1 offset 1;

answer: chromosome 9, 5 cancer related genes

2)
select count(*) from gene join transcript on gene.gene_id = transcript.gene_id join exon_transcript on transcript.transcript_id = exon_transcript.transcript_id join exon on exon_transcript.exon_id = exon.exon_id where chromosome = 9; 

answer: chromosome 9 has 45679 exons

QUESTION 7:

select count(*) from exon;
select count(*) from exon_transcript;

there is a difference because every exon can have multiple transcript variants!
